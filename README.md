## Run Locally

You'll want to run the site locally to test your changes.

First make sure you have Ruby and Bundler:

1. Check that Ruby is installed (check with `ruby -v`). Must be 2.2.5 or higher. Install instruction at https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/.
2. If you don't already have Bundler (check with `which bundle`), you can install by following the instructions at https://bundler.io.

Then clone the source code, build, and serve:

3. Clone this repository and `cd` into it.
4. Run `bundle install`.
5. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
6. Browse the site at http://127.0.0.1:4000/
