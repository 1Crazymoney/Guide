# The bitcoin design guide

**Bitcoin is a global payment protocol that anyone with Internet access can participate in and contribute to. However, because bitcoin’s use cases are as vast as its user base, building bitcoin applications can be complicated.**

We designed this guide to help anyone navigate those complexities—regardless of where they live or work. We can’t imagine every possible use case, but we can help you build for them.

## What's in it?

The Bitcoin Design Guide is divided into the following sections:

- [Getting started]({{ '/guide/getting-started/introduction/' | relative_url }}) provides top-level overviews of common visual language, software, and best practices for design collaboration
- [Onboarding]({{ '/guide/onboarding/introduction/' | relative_url }}) introduces new users to must know bitcoin terms, products, and features
- [Private key management]({{ '/guide/private-key-management/introduction/' | relative_url }}) details the many techniques that can be used to store private keys
- [Payments]({{ '/guide/payments/' | relative_url }}) covers the complexities encountered when sending and receiving bitcoin
- [Foundations]({{ '/guide/foundations/' | relative_url }}) highlights principles and other fundamentals designing Bitcoin products
- [Case studies]({{ '/guide/case-studies/' | relative_url }}) explores wire framing, designing, and prototyping for diverse use cases
- [Glossary]({{ '/guide/glossary/' | relative_url }}) helps you learn the most need-to-know bitcoin terminology from Address to ZPUB

## How to use the guide

Can’t find what you’re looking for? Try [asking the community](http://bitcoindesigners.org), [filing an issue]({{site.github_repository_url}}issues), or using the search function.

## A community effort

We based this guide on the same philosophy of decentralization that bitcoin is built on. This means that no single person, company, or government has control over the guide. Instead, it is maintained by an open and informal community of designers and design enthusiasts. Everyone is welcome to contribute.
