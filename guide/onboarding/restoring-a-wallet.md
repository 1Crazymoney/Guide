# Restoring a wallet

<div class="center" markdown="1">

There are several reasons why a user might need to restore their wallet. They may have lost their device, are migrating from a different application or deleted their wallet application. Regardless of why, itâ€™s important that your wallet application has an easy way for users to recover their funds. 

However, not all wallets from one application can be recovered in another, depending on what standards they support as covered in the [wallet interoperability]({{ 'guide/designing-products/wallet-interoperability' | relative_url }}) section. This is particularly true for a wallet holding bitcoin on the Lightning network, and restoring should be done with the application originally used.

### Restore from an automatic cloud backup

As outlined earlier in the chapter, we consider an automatic cloud backup a good option, especially for beginners. One of the major UX benefits of this is a seamless recovery process. Assuming they are restoring in the same wallet application originally used, all the user needs to do to gain access to their funds again is to log into their cloud storage account.

### Restore manually with a recovery phrase

Users may have created a wallet with another wallet application. In this case, they should be able to import that wallet into yours by entering their 12 or 24-word recovery phrase. There are several options for the UI when entering a recovery phase, as outlined earlier in the [manual backup]({{ 'guide/onboarding/backing-up-a-recovery-phrase/manual-backup/' | relative_url }}) section of this chapter.

### Restore from an encrypted QR code backup

Some applications  also provide an option for users to scan an encrypted proprietary QR code version of their recovery phrase. For a more detailed explanation of this recovery technique check out this [blog post](https://blog.keys.casa/product-update-transaction-memos-encrypted-backups/) by Casa.

### Restore a wallet with funds on the Lightning network

To fully restore a wallet with funds on the [Lightning network](/guide/glossary/#lightning-network), the state and history of the payment channels are needed in addition to the recovery phrase. As there are no standards for this yet, wallet applications need to have their own format for backing this up, and subsequently restoring. Due to the amount of data, an encrypted QR code like in the previous example can be appropriate. 

Some less popular methods for restoring a wallet include importing a file with all the information required to recover funds such as public keys and key metadata. A wallet.dat file from Bitcoin Core is one example of such a file scheme. If you are developing a watch-only wallet, you would import an [extended public key](/guide/glossary/#extended-public-key-xpub-ypub-zpub) instead of the recovery phrase, this tends to be for technically minded users however.
