# Transaction privacy

<!--
This page should inform about what information is made public when sending or receiving, how the application can help minimize unnecessary privacy leaks, basic application functionality to help, and when we can, more advanced options.
- Single-use addresses (avoiding address reuse)
- Coin selection / labelling
- Coin join / Pay join
-->

It’s a common misconception that Bitcoin is anonymous. Instead, it is referred to as pseudonymous which means each address you generate is like a new identity. When mined, transactions, their signatures, and addresses are public on the ledger, forever. There is also no personally identifiable information attached to transactions on the blockchain though. This transparent property of the Bitcoin blockchain allows anyone to easily verify the amount of Bitcoin in existence and look up any address or transaction. This can be done going back to the first one on [2009-01-03](https://blockstream.info/tx/4a5e1e4baab89f3a32518a88c31bc87f618f76673e2cc77ab2127b7afdeda33b), a transaction mined by Satoshi Nakamoto.

The key to keeping your transactions private is to prevent others from determining which addresses you own[^3]. Satoshi let others know that they mined the first block, which contained just one transaction, the block reward sent to their address. This illustrates the permanence of the association to an address and an identity. That being said, the pseudonym “Satoshi Nakamoto” also contributes to further anonymity. Once an address owner's identity is made public it becomes a difficult task to break the connection.

## Methods to preserve privacy

Keeping private takes constant and diligent work but is not impossible to achieve an acceptable level of privacy[^1]. Let’s explore some methods and practices that can help preserve privacy on a transaction level.

<!-- talk about the problem as you are talking about the solution -->

### Generate a new address for each payment

Creating new online personas is not the only way to preserve privacy. A new address can be generated by the wallet application to receive bitcoin. This is done using [HD Wallets]({{ "/guide/glossary/#hd-wallet" | relative_url }}), a standard for how private keys get generated in modern bitcoin applications. This allows each transaction not to be tied to a single address, making it more difficult to make an association to the owner.

> If thieves can see your income, holdings, and spending, they can use this information to target and exploit you.[^2]

Using the same address multiple times does not only degrade the privacy of just one transacting party. Both the [sender](/guide/payments/receive) and [receiver](/guide/payments/receive) are put at risk. On the receiver’s side, by using a single address, senders, or anyone with whom the address is shared can see the previous activity and the amount of bitcoin controlled by the owner.

Assuming an adversary can uncover the identity behind the reused address there is now a single point for them to reach anyone else who has transacted with the owner.

> * You save in bitcoin, using a single-address paper wallet.
> * All your bitcoin savings to this same address, let's say it contains $1 million worth.
> * You buy a small amount of bitcoins to add to your savings, depositing in the paper wallet.
> * The person who sold you the bitcoins follows their trail on the blockchain and finds your paper wallet containing $1 million.
> * He mentions it to someone in a cafe or bar.
> * Word gets around. A burglar raids your home. Kidnappers capture your children and know exactly how much to demand in ransom.

**Do's**

- Make it easy to generate as many addresses as the receiver needs at a time.
- Before broadcasting a transaction, inform senders if an address is already used.

**Don'ts**

- Make it easy to reuse an address.

### Keep track of who about knows about an address

<div class="center" markdown="1">

{% include image.html
   image = "/assets/images/guide/payments/privacy/address-labeling.jpg"
   retina = "/assets/images/guide/payments/privacy/address-labeling@2x.jpg"
   alt-text = "A list of addresses with tags. Two are red, two are purple and one is blue"
   width = 400
   height = 400
   layout = "float-right-desktop"
%}

When [receiving bitcoin]({{ "/guide/payments/receive/" | relative_url }}) we can [add additional details to a payment]({{ "/guide/payments/receive/#inputting-additional-payment-details" | relative_url }}). Not only does this help to contextualize payments, but it also enables preventative measures for preserving privacy. Labeling addresses with the counterparty's name involved in each transaction can inform decisions for which [UTXOs]({{ "/guide/glossary/#unspent-transaction-output-utxo" | relative_url }}) are selected in future transaction inputs.

To make this UTXO selection easier, some interfaces make it possible to select/filter UTXOs that cluster under one label.

### Increase anonymity by collaborating with others

<div class="center" markdown="1">

{% include image.html
   image = "/assets/images/guide/payments/privacy/coin-join.jpg"
   retina = "/assets/images/guide/payments/privacy/coin-join@2x.jpg"
   alt-text = "Example CoinJoin transaction with 3 participants with 1 input each, which get broken up into 5 equal outputs."
   width = 400
   height = 400
   layout = "float-right-desktop"
%}

The "common input ownership" heuristic assumes that in a transaction, it is most likely that all inputs belong to the same owner. [CoinJoins]({{ "/guide/glossary/#coinjoin" | relative_url }}) is a technique where multiple participants collaborate on a transaction to break this heuristic. It becomes more difficult (although not impossible) to determine who the individuals who own the outputs are since all the outputs typically have the same denomination. With CoinJoins, as with any other anonymity network, a large and diverse group of participants provides the best protection.

Users still have to be mindful of how the UTXOs they received from the CoinJoin are spent. For instance, spending them together in a single transaction would unravel the anonymity gains from participating in the CoinJoin.

### Design with privacy in mind

Thinking about privacy is critical to keep in mind during the design process. Your users will not have the same level of knowledge of how to use Bitcoin privately. It becomes especially critical to understand the implications of their privacy degrading actions at the point of creating a transaction or requesting a payment.

While there is no perfect solution that will guarantee 100% privacy, try always to minimize how much information gets shared to the most essential. Also, consider ways to inform and prevent users of actions that negatively impact their privacy as they use your product.

<!--
There is no perfect solution to guarantee 100% privacy that lasts forever because things can be revealed over time. Since transactions are forever public, even if all precautions are taken at the time of payment to ensure the highest degree of anonymity, future behaviors of the wallet owner or transacting parties can still degrade previously attained privacy. A high amount of diligence is necessary whenever users are transacting with Bitcoin. The product should be able to guide, inform, and prevent them against privacy degrading actions.
