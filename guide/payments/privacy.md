# Transaction privacy

<!--
This page should inform about what information is made public when sending or receiving, how the application can help minimize unnecessary privacy leaks, basic application functionality to help, and when we can, more advanced options.
- Single-use addresses (avoiding address reuse)
- Coin selection / labelling
- Coin join / Pay join
-->

It’s a common misconception that Bitcoin is anonymous. Instead, it is referred to as pseudonymous which means each address you generate is like a new identity. When mined, transactions and their signatures, and addresses are public on the ledger forever. This transparent property of the Bitcoin blockchain allows anyone to easily verify the amount of Bitcoin in existence and look up any address or transaction. This can be done going back to the first one on [2009-01-03](https://blockstream.info/tx/4a5e1e4baab89f3a32518a88c31bc87f618f76673e2cc77ab2127b7afdeda33b), a transaction mined by Satoshi Nakamoto.

The key to keeping your transactions private is to prevent others from determining which addresses you own[^3]. Satoshi let others know that they mined the first block, which contained just one transaction with the block reward being sent to their address. This illustrates the permanence of the association to the address and the identity. That being said, the pseudonym “Satoshi Nakamoto” also contributes to further anonymity.

Creating new online personas is not the only way to gain more privacy. In Bitcoin, it’s easy to create new identities. A new address can be generated by the wallet application to receive bitcoin. This is done using [HD Wallets]({{ "/guide/glossary/#hd-wallet" | relative_url }}) which is a standard for how private keys get generated. This allows each transaction is not tied to a single address, making it more difficult to make the association with the owner

There is also no personally identifiable information attached to transactions on the blockchain. Thinking about privacy is still critical to keep in mind during the design process. Your users will not have the same level of knowledge in how to use Bitcoin privately. It is at the point of creating a transaction or requesting a payment that it becomes most critical to understand the possible implications of their actions. Consider ways that you can help guide and inform them of actions that could impact their privacy as they use your product.

Each Bitcoin transaction contains at least one input (where the Bitcoin are from) and at least one output (where the Bitcoin are being sent). This means that once a single address is known, there is a trail to follow the Bitcoin.

## Methods to enhance privacy

Keeping private takes constant and diligent work but is not impossible to achieve an acceptable level of privacy[1]. Let’s explore some methods and practices that can help enhance transaction privacy.

<!-- talk about the problem as you are talking about the solution -->

### Address reuse

Using the same address multiple times does not only degrade the privacy of just one transacting party. Both the [sender](/guide/payments/receive) and [receiver](/guide/payments/receive) are at risk. On the receiver’s side, by using a single address to transact with everyone, senders, or anyone with whom the address is shared would see the previous activity and balance of the receiver.

> If thieves can see your income, holdings, and spending, they can use this information to target and exploit you.[^2]

Assuming an adversary can uncover the identity behind the reused address there is now a single point for them to reach anyone else who has transacted with the address.

consider how to get the ui generating multiple addresses. make it easy for the user to not fail 

> ###### Worked Example 1 - Savings Revealed
> * You save in bitcoin, using a single-address paper wallet.
> * All your bitcoin savings to this same address, let's say it contains $1 million worth.
> * You buy a small amount of bitcoins to add to your savings, depositing in the paper wallet.
> * The person who sold you the bitcoins follows their trail on the blockchain and finds your paper wallet containing $1 million.
> * He mentions it to someone in a cafe or bar.
> * Word gets around. A burglar raids your home. Kidnappers capture your children and know exactly how much to demand in ransom.

**Do's**

- Make it easy to generate as many addresses as the receiver needs at a time.
- Before broadcasting a transaction, inform senders if an address is already used.

**Don'ts**

- Make it easy to reuse an address.

### Labeling and Coin control
When [receiving bitcoin]({{ "/guide/payments/receive/" | relative_url }}) we went through the steps to [input additional details to a payment]({{ "/guide/payments/receive/#inputting-additional-payment-details" | relative_url }}) through labeling. Not only does this practice help with contextualizing payments, but it also enables preventative measures for enhancing privacy. Separating addresses by labeling them with the other participants of the transaction can help users make more informed decisions in the future when selecting [UTXOs]({{ "/guide/glossary/#unspent-transaction-output-utxo" | relative_url }}) to use as a transaction's input.

**Do's**
- Each address shared is labeled with a list of parties who can identify the owner.
- Make it possible to select/filter UTXOs that cluster under one label.

_Check out the glossary to learn more about [how coin control works]({{ "/guide/glossary/#coin-control" | relative_url }})._

### CoinJoins

The “common input ownership” heuristic assumes that in a transaction, it is most likely that all inputs belong to the same owner. Coinjoins are a technique for multiple people to collaborate on a transaction to break this heuristic. Therefore it becomes more difficult (although not impossible) to determine who the individuals who own the outputs are since all the outputs typically have the same denomination. In CoinJoins a large and diverse group of participants provides better protection.

There is no perfect solution that will guarantee 100% privacy lasting forever because things can be revealed over time. Since transactions are forever public, even if all precautions are taken at the time of payment to ensure the highest degree of anonymity, future behaviors can still degrade previously attained privacy. A high amount of diligence is necessary whenever users are transacting with bitcoin, but most importantly the usability of privacy is.
