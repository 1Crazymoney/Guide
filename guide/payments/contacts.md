# Contacts
{:.no_toc}

<!--


-->

Whether weâ€™re sending emails, physical mail, or following someone on social media, we primarily think in terms of names and faces, and not the respective address or user ID.

Invoices, node IDs and other transaction endpoints in bitcoin and Lightning are highly unintuitive. Abstracting them via a contact list can create a much smoother user experience. There are many [payment request formats]({{ '/guide/payments/request/payment-request-formats/' | relative_url }}), each with unique properties and varying levels of maturity and adoption, requiring unique design solutions. This page uses the more approachable term "address", along with various UI techniques, to abstract these complexities for users.

Let's go over common user interactions around contacts. This will illustrate how such a feature could work, and helps explain the underlying design problems and decisions.

### Adding a contact

The most basic interaction is that a user manually adds a contact by entering their name and an address. This is likely not the most common user flow, as most contacts will be added to incoming payment requests, as illustrated further below. But wallets should generally support manual options, as users may not be able to avoid them.

{% include image-gallery.html pages = page.imagesAddContact %}

### Supporting various payment request formats

Based on your use case, your application may choose to only support certain payment request formats. It should still recognize all formats, and provide the user with appropriate feedback. You may also choose to add warnings before permitting use of certain formats if there are privacy and security risks the user should be aware of.

{% include image-gallery.html pages = page.imagesSupportedFormats %}

### Contact editing

The contacts screen should offer various features for editing and organization. Also see [Requesting bitcoin &middot; Contact cards]({{ '/guide/payments/request/#contact-cards' | relative_url }}).

{% include image-gallery.html pages = page.imagesMultiAddressContact %}

### Importing an address

In this scenario, the user has copied a Lightning address to the clipboard and opened the app. The clipboard is automatically scanned, the app identifies the addres and offers the user appropriate options. Here, the user adds the address as a new contact.

{% include image-gallery.html pages = page.imagesImportAddress %}

This flow can also be initiated by scanning a QR code or tapping a payment link. For more, see [Sending bitcoin &middot; Payment entry points]({{ '/guide/payments/send/#payment-entry-points' | relative_url }}).

### Importing an invoice

Here, the user has scanned a payment request and assigns a contact to the payment.

Some payment request formats may include an address that can receive payments repeatedly. In this case, the address is added to the contact for future use. Otherwise, only the payment is linked.

Invoices may also contain recipient names. These can be used to suggest the name for a new contact to the user. Names can be spoofed, so they should not be automatically assigned without user approval.

{% include image-gallery.html pages = page.imagesPayInvoice %}

### Sending from the home screen

Initiating a payment can be as simple as entering an amount and tapping a contact that has a re-usable address associated. Otherwise, an extra step is needed to manually enter a destination address.

{% include image-gallery.html pages = page.imagesHome %}

### Adding a contact to an outgoing invoice

Contacts can also be assigned to invoices that will be paid by others.

{% include image-gallery.html pages = page.imagesReceive %}

### Adding a contact to a completed payment

When browsing the [activity]({{ '/guide/payments/activity/' | relative_url }}) screen, users may come across payments they want to assign contacts to. While applications should try to automatically make connections between payments and contacts by matching addresses, this is not possible oftentimes.

{% include image-gallery.html pages = page.imagesActivity %}

Contacts are closely intertwined with [sending]({{ '/guide/payments/send/' | relative_url }}), [requesting]({{ '/guide/payments/request/' | relative_url }}), and the [activity]({{ '/guide/payments/activity/' | relative_url }}) screen. When designing these user flows, pay close attention to how they connect. The less convenient it is for users to assign contacts, the less likely they are to use this feature and the higher the chance that they are exposed to the complexities of the various payment request formats.

Next, we cover [privacy considerations]({{ '/guide/payments/privacy' | relative_url }}) when to consider when making bitcoin payments.

{% include next-previous.html
   previousUrl = "/guide/payments/activity"
   previousName = "Activity"
   nextUrl = "/guide/payments/privacy/"
   nextName = "Payments privacy"
%}
