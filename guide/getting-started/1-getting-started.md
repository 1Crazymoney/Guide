# Design Bitcoin for everyone

Wouldn’t it be great if we could send money to anyone in the world as easily as we can send emails and text messages? That’s one of the promises of Bitcoin. Since it was [first introduced in 2009](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf){:target="_blank"}, it has become a globally recognized money and a public good. As it has grown in importance and its use has become more diverse, the need to make it more usable and more useful for more people across the world has increased. Since bitcoin was designed in a way that there is no central entity that defines what it should be like, each of us can help shape it. Many already have, as is reflected in the thousands of projects and businesses that already form a vibrant ecosystem. With this guide, we hope to provide information, background, best practices and resources for anyone who wants to design a product or service that uses bitcoin.

## By the people, for the people

One of the unique aspects of Bitcoin is that it is an open-source project and no single group, company or government owns or controls it. That means all of us can freely participate and contribute as much or as little as we want. All contributions are equally valid, and there are no gatekeepers. This decentralization is an incredibly important property for a global currency as it provides a level playing field. It also means that there are many different people independently working on different projects, and that we need to help each other to make Bitcoin as useful for as many people as possible.

This guide is an example of this. It was created and is maintained by a community of designers and design enthusiasts that want to help improve the overall level of design in the Bitcoin ecosystem. It is continuously improved and you are welcome to help, whether it’s providing feedback or adding more content.

While there are many businesses offering Bitcoin services, this guide is dedicated primarily to non-custodial user experiences. Just like you are fully in control of the cash you carry in your wallet, non-custodial Bitcoin experiences mean that users fully own and control their Bitcoin. Because this puts more responsibility on users, these experiences are much harder to design and implement. Yet, they are fundamental to the nature of Bitcoin, and should remain the default way to use Bitcoin.

If you are new to bitcoin, keep reading for an introduction on why bitcoin is so unique and what makes it so interesting and worthwhile to be involved. As a more experienced reader, you are more than welcome to skip straight to the sections that interest you most. And if you don’t find what you are looking for, file an issue and help us add it.
