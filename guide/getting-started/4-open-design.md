# Open design

In a broader view, open design is an alternative method for design and development, based on the free exchange of comprehensive design information. It tries to balance the independence of individual designers and the collective power of collaboration. The larger goal is to enable and promote design projects, which are motivated by personal conviction and passion of designers for the greater benefit of a global society.

In our context, open design can manifest itself in a different ways. You might:

* contribute as a designer to a specific open-source project
* have a topic of interest and collaborate with multiple people and projects
* create a design resource library (like an icon set or UI Kit) that you share on Github
* contribute to this Bitcoin Design Guide

Whichever it may be, it is a voluntary, public contribution to efforts that you think are worthwhile. From these individual efforts, a network of people and projects emerges that is only loosely bound through personal relationships, communities, or the work itself. This is different from common corporate structures and requires individuals to think and act more independently and be comfortable with ambiguity.

Open-source software has existed and matured for decades, while open design is not as widely known or practiced. Starting to design for bitcoin products can therefore sometimes be disorienting, as many designers need to adjust not just how they work, but also the relationship to their work. No longer is the design an artefact only controlled by just the designer or a small group of people inside an organzation, but it becomes part of a public conversation where anyone is invited to help shape it. In open-source software, this public review and debate often leads to better results, and this ideally carries over to open design.

##  Open design and Bitcoin

Bitcoin has the spirit of openness deeply embedded. The source code is public, participation in the network is public and unrestricted, and transfering value via Bitcoin is as well. Thousands of projects have copied ideas, techniques and code from Bitcoin to experiment and explore different directions. This is a fantastic foundation for designers to also contribute in this open and participatory manner.

One might argue that Bitcoin needs open design in order to stay true to its founding values. Users don't interact with a technical protocol, but with applications built on top of it. If those applications end up centralized, then it will not matter if the protocol is open. So it is up to the people shaping the open-source application layer to ensure that the future of Bitcoin remains decentralized and participatory.

## Getting started

As mentioned above, it can be difficult to find a starting point in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Here are a few tips to help find your way around:

- Download a Bitcoin wallet and experiment with small amounts. You can alse use Testnet, which allows you use all the features but with worthless Bitcoin. Pay attention to the experience and come up with ways to improve it.
- Join the Bitcoin Design Community on Slack and see what others are discussing. A good way to get started is by asking questions and joining conversations that interest you.
- Redesign a Bitcoin application of your choice. Even as a brief exercise, a redesign is a great way to develop deeper understanding of how something works and why certain decisions were made.
- Read, watch and listen. There is a lot of great material out there to learn more about Bitcoin. Design-focused content is unfortunately not as common but expanding into related materials (like finance) might help.

## Licensing

Licenses help ensure that bad actors cannot abuse this open system by taking the published work and pretend it's their own, patent it, redistribute it under a commercial license, or otherwise profit from it. A variety of licenses have been created by the open-source movement to accomodate different types of projects and situations.
