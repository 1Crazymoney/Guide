# Usage life cycle
{:.no_toc}

We have all mastered different skills and tools that we care about or use frequently. Many times we forget what the initial struggles were once we reach a certain comfort level. A similar change happens when we develop products. We learn and internalize different mechanisms and logic and what was once hard becomes intuitive, and we my end up building things with overwhelming learning curves. So it's a healthy habit to regularly take a step back and look through the eyes users at different levels of experience with your product.

## Unaware
Every user starts here and most remain in this phase. At this point, they have never heard or seen your company or product before. 

## Aware
A user hears about the service for the first time. This could be via a word of mouth recommendation, advertising, a news article, social media, or any other channel. Either way, this exposure is probably extremely short and limited, so itâ€™s important that the purpose and benefits of your product are clear.

## Interested
A user becomes interested in your product. Maybe they have heard about it several times or their first interaction was convincing enough that they decide to try the product. At this point, they generally understand the benefits and likely have a need for the product that they are looking to address. They evaluate your product, and you as the creator, from multiple perspectives to make an informed decision whether to move forward. Is this a convenient way to get done what I want to do? Can I trust this product and its creators? What can I lose? Can I get out if something geos wrong? If most questions can be answered positively, users take the next steps.

## First use
The user tries the service out for the first time. They made an intentional decision to move forward and expect to be satisfied. They are still not too familiar with your product and their expectations may not match what your product actually offers. Thefore it is very important to pay close attention to the design of the first-time use, also known as onboarding experience. Users should be able to quickly and successfully achieve the task they have in mind, while getting introduced to the basic concepts and best practices for using your product. This experience sets expectations for future interactions. If the first use is frustrating, users are less likely to come back.

## Regular use
Through repeat use, the user becomes more familiar with the service and starts using more features, in a more sophisticated manner.

## Passionate use
These are expert users with high expectations. They will express strong wishes, provide feedback and also spread the word to potential new users.
