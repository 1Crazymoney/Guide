# Getting started

Welcome to bitcoin, you're in for an adventure. This chapter is all about the big concepts you should be aware of when creating bitcoin products. On this page, you'll find a brief summary that allows you to dig deeper into the sections you are most interested in.

---

**[Why bitcoin is unique]({{ '/getting-started/why-bitcoin-is-unique/' | relative_url }})**

The internet has opened an endless, open design space for information and communication. Bitcoin does the same for money and the transfer of value.

---

**[Why design for bitcoin]({{ '/getting-started/why-design-for-bitcoin/' | relative_url }})**

Bitcoin is cutting-edge technology that's unlike previous digital innovations. Yet it is fundamentally open and participatory and allows designers and creators to explore and shape our experiences.

---

**[Open design]({{ '/getting-started/open-design/' | relative_url }})**

Help shape bitcoin products for a global audience, free from traditional agency or in-house design structures. Open design and open source allow for open collaboration driven by people who care to make a difference.

---

**[The visual language of bitcoin]({{ '/getting-started/visual-language/' | relative_url }})**

As an open and public protocol, bitcoin does not have a strictly defined brand. Yet there is a recognizable symbol that has evolved over time and been remixed over and over.

---

**[User research]({{ '/getting-started/user-research/' | relative_url }})**

All products begin with user needs and end in those same users hands. User research is a fundamental activity in getting from building things to building the things that people care about.

---

**[Personal finance]({{ '/getting-started/personal-finance/' | relative_url }})**

If we consider bitcoin money, we need to consider how bitcoin users think about their finances. This page provides a simple framework that can serve as a starting point, deriving bitcoin software and hardware setups from budgeting categories.

---

**[Usage life cycle]({{ '/getting-started/usage-life-cycle/' | relative_url }})**

We all start without any knowledge of bitcoin or your product. As we learn more, our understanding and needs change. As designers, it is important to guide users through this experience.

---

**[Common user flows]({{ '/getting-started/common-user-flows/' | relative_url }})**

Most bitcoin applications share certain user activities, from initial setup to making a transaction. It is important to follow patterns and behaviors users expect to reduce the chance of mistakes.

---

**[Technology primer]({{ '/getting-started/technology-primer/' | relative_url }})**

Learn some of the basic concepts behind the technologies that make bitcoin work, through the lens of designing user experiences.

---

**[Software overview]({{ '/getting-started/software/' | relative_url }})**

Bitcoin applications roughly fall into a defined set of categories, from consumer-friendly wallets, to merchant tools, and more.

---

**[Hardware overview]({{ '/getting-started/hardware/' | relative_url }})**

Whether it's for security or participating in the bitcoin network, bitcoin hardware is an essential part of the ecosystem and user experience.
