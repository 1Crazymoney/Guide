# Usage life cycle

<!--

This series of steps describes the change in familiarity of a (potential) user for your product - from somebody who has never heard of it all the way to power user. It is helpful to think through each phase and consider what your users needs are, what their understanding of bitcoin and your product likely is, and how you can help them successfully navigate.

## Unaware
Every user starts here. They have never heard or seen your company or product before. Word of mouth recommendations, marketing or network effects may 

## Aware
A user hears about the service for the first time. This could be via a word of mouth recommendation, advertising, or other channels. This exposure is probably extremely short and limited, so itâ€™s important that the purpose and benefits of your product are clear.

## Interested
A user gets interested in the service. Maybe they have heard about it several times or their first interaction was convincing enough that they decide to try the product. At this point, they generally understand the benefits and likely have a need for the product that they are looking to address. 

## First use
The user tries the service out for the first time. Basic concepts need to be explained and ideally the user can successfully achieve a task to set them up for the next steps. This experience sets expectations for future interactions.

## Regular use
Through repeat use, the user becomes more familiar with the service and starts using more features, in a more sophisticated manner.

## Passionate use
These are expert users with high expectations. They will express strong wishes, provide feedback and also spread the word to potential new users.
