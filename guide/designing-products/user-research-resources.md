# User research resources

Below is a collection of published user research findings around Bitcoin, from academic papers to surveys and blog posts.

## Research papers

###### [Non-adoption of crypto-assets: Exploring the role of trust, self-efficacy, and risk](https://voskart.de/pdf/crypto_adoption.pdf)

*Over the last years, crypto-assets have gained significant interest from private investors, academia, and industry. While the user population and their motivations, perceptions, and behaviors have been studied, non-adopters and factors influencing their decision have been left unexplored. This work fills this knowledge gap and sheds light on the effects of trust, perceived self-efficacy, and risk, which have been shown to be the key antecedents to technology acceptance, on the adoption intention of non-users.*

###### [Bits Under the Mattress: Understanding Different Risk Perceptions and Security Behaviors of Crypto-Asset Users](https://voskart.de/pdf/bits_under_mattress.pdf)

*Prior empirical work has attempted to study end-user security from both technical and organizational perspectives. However, the link between individuals’ risk perceptions and security behavior was often obscured by the heterogeneity of the subjects in small samples. This paper contributes quantitative results from a survey of 395 crypto-asset users recruited by a novel combination of deep and broad sampling. The analysis accounts for heterogeneity with a new typology that partitions the sample in three robust clusters – cypherpunks, hodlers, and rookies – using five psychometric constructs.*

###### [The U in Crypto Stands for Usable: An Empirical Study of User Experience with Mobile Cryptocurrency Wallets](https://voskart.de/pdf/u_in_crypto.pdf)

*In a corpus of 45,821 app reviews of the top five mobile cryptocurrency wallets, 6,859 reviews were identified and qualitatively analyzed pertaining to the user experience with those wallets. The analysis suggests that both new and experienced users struggle with general and domain-specific UX issues that, aside from frustration and disengagement, might lead to dangerous errors and irreversible monetary losses. We reveal shortcomings of current wallet UX as well as users’ misconceptions, some of which can be traced back to a reliance on their understanding of conventional payment systems.*

###### [User Perception of Bitcoin Usability and Security across Novice Users](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331286661_User_Perception_of_Bitcoin_Usability_and_Security_across_Novice_Users)

*This paper investigates users’ perceptions and experiences of an anonymous digital payment system (Bitcoin) and its influence on users in terms of usability and security in comparison to other non-anonymous payment systems such as credit/debit cards. This paper identifies users’ perceptual differences in terms of usability and security. We conclude that Bitcoin, as a crypto-currency, is still in its infancy and requires user education and a new way of thinking. The study recommends developing users’ mental models to deepen developers’ understanding of anonymous digital payment technology and improve user-centred design.*

###### [A First Look at the Usability of Bitcoin Key Management](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.04351.pdf)

*Bitcoin users are directly or indirectly forced to deal with public key cryptography, which has a number of security and usability challenges that differ from the password-based authentication underlying most online banking services. In this paper, we contribute an evaluation framework for comparing Bitcoin key management approaches, and conduct a broad usability evaluation of six representative Bitcoin clients. We find that Bitcoin shares many of the fundamental challenges of key management known from other domains, but that Bitcoin may present a unique opportunity to rethink key management for end users.*

###### [An Evaluation of User Attitudes Towards Anonymity in Bitcoin](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1141672/FULLTEXT01.pdf)

*The research effort presented in this paper consists of a quantitative study seeking to address the subject of user anonymity in the Bitcoin network. The survey seeks to form an understanding of user attitudes towards the aspect of anonymity by following a methodological approach for exploring common tendencies among the representatives and will serve as the underlying data set from which conclusions can be drawn. Furthermore, this paper will present a literary study of the actual state of anonymity in this peer-to-peer technology by reviewing current findings highlighted in the area, thus presenting a comprehensive view of anonymity in the Bitcoin network.*

###### [The Other Side of the Coin: User Experiences with Bitcoin Security and Privacy](https://publications.sba-research.org/publications/TheOtherSideOfTheCoin_FC16preConf.pdf)

*The paper presents the first large-scale survey to investigate how users experience the Bitcoin ecosystem in terms of security, privacy and anonymity. 990 Bitcoin users were surveyed to determine Bitcoin management strategies and identified how users deploy security measures to protect their keys and bitcoins. It was also found that many users do not use all security capabilities of their selected Bitcoin management tool and have significant misconceptions on how to remain anonymous and protect their privacy in the Bitcoin network. To get a deeper understanding, qualitative interviews were conducted to explain some of the observed phenomena.*

## Surveys

###### [Project Horizon](https://youtu.be/oZkBU5H2WjY)

*Jamaal shared his findings from Project Horizon, which was an investigation into how people use (or don't use) Bitcoin Core Wallet and what needs are unmet by a variety of users. The project employed both qualitative interviews along with surveys to understand a variety of user needs and approaches to using Bitcoin. We then had a good discussion about what the future of the Bitcoin Core Wallet might be.*

###### [A study on how Bitcoin is perceived by no-coiners (non-holders of Bitcoin)](https://github.com/MickMorucci/Bitcoin_perception)

*Beliefs drive behaviour more than the other way around. So, if we are trying to understand those who know about but have not purchased Bitcoin, we want to try to understand their beliefs surrounding Bitcoin and their perception of it. This research aims to gain a better picture of the beliefs of no-coiners about Bitcoin. Understanding these beliefs can help point to their behaviours, their non-action when buying Bitcoin. The objective is to gain a comprehensive list of these beliefs surrounding Bitcoin.*

Launched in January 2021 by Mick Morucci. In progress.

###### [Bitcoin is (Still) a Demographic Mega-trend: Data Update](https://medium.com/blockchain-capital-blog/bitcoin-is-still-a-demographic-mega-trend-data-update-c50df59a6cb3)

*Every 18 months the team at Blockchain Capital commissions The Harris Poll to conduct a nationwide online survey of over 2,000 US adults to gauge the progression of the US general population through the crypto adoption funnel. This survey is intended to gauge the general population’s awareness, familiarity, perception, conviction, relative preference rates and propensity to purchase crypto.*

###### [Blockchain Usability Report](https://fioprotocol.io/wp-content/themes/fio/build/files/blockchain-usability-report-2019.pdf)

*For blockchain to achieve its potential, the value and information represented on blockchains ultimately needs to be moved between parties for the purpose of commerce and/or utility. There have been many hypotheses on what blockchain “needs” for mass adoption to occur and one of recurring topics of discussion is usability. To understand this problem better, FIO – the Foundation for Interwallet Operability – conducted a randomized survey of over 200 crypto holders. These users were asked various questions regarding their frequency and experiences in transacting crypto, with the goal of unearthing some of the common issues they’ve faced.*

###### [2nd Global Cryptoasset Benchmarking Study](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/faculty-research/centres/alternative-finance/publications/2nd-global-cryptoasset-benchmark-study/#.X_1mxi1h1qs)

*The second edition of the Global Cryptoasset Benchmarking Study provides new insights into the current state of the cryptoasset industry. The study gathers survey data from more than 180 cryptoasset companies and individuals, covering 47 countries across five world regions. The empirical analysis specifically focuses on the following four key industry segments: mining, exchange, storage, and payments.*

## Blog posts & write-ups

###### [Automatic Cloud Backup (Seedless) Wallet Research](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11KbQnor7kQPdzHKmycBLPwOKyVo3t99nUEQYpVsik_o/edit?usp=sharing)

*According to research conducted, users who are new to crypto lack confidence in their ability to safely hold and keep track of their seed phrase. It’s no secret that manually writing down a 12-24 word seed phrase mnemonic is an unfamiliar motion, causing this user group to accidentally misplace their seed phrase. As designers and product builders, our number 1 priority should be to create experiences that not only ensure the physical safety of a user’s funds, but the emotional security as well. At a high level, the goal of this research is to discover if automatic cloud backups can empower new-to-crypto users to confidently create and secure their own bitcoin wallets.*

###### [Making design better for crypto apps: Abra UX Case study](https://medium.com/@kagakawa/abra-app-ux-case-study-2eb2a6e09c70) 

*While working in blockchain industry for over 3+ years Kagayaki Kawabata realized there are many unintuitive apps that are difficult to use. There were difficulties buying coins using the Abra’s app, The assumption was made that other users also have the same issues. Through this UX case study, Kawabata will help pursue Abra’s mission statement “cryptocurrency investing simplified.” by exploring the human-centered design process by evaluating the usability of apps.*
